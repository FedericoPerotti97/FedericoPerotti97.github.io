                        <h3>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</h3>
                        <p>When Kareem Abdul-Jabbar left the game in 1989 at age 42, no NBA player had ever scored more points, blocked more shots, won more Most Valuable Player Awards, played in more All-Star Games or logged more seasons.</p>

                        <h3>Charles Barkley</h3>
                        <p>As a player, Charles Barkley was perhaps the greatest anomaly in basketball history. Listed at 6-6 but actually closer to 6-foot-4, he played power forward as well as anyone in the history of the NBA, often dominating players half a foot taller.</p>

                        <h3>Larry Bird</h3>
                        <p>Once every generation or so, a player comes along who can truly be called a superstar. Larry Bird was such a player.For 13 seasons with the Boston Celtics, from 1979-80 through 1991-92, Bird personified hustle, consistency and excellence in all areas of play — as a scorer, a passer, a rebounder, a defender, a team player, and, perhaps above all, as a clutch performer. Bird was so self-confident that he was known to waltz up to the opponents’ bench before tipoff and predict a 40-point performance for himself.</p>

                        <h3>Wilt Chamberlain</h3>
                        <p>He was basketball’s unstoppable force, the most awesome offensive force the game has ever seen. Asked to name the greatest players ever to play basketball, most fans and aficionados would put Wilt Chamberlain at or near the top of the list.Dominating the game as few players in any sport ever have, Chamberlain seemed capable of scoring and rebounding at will, despite the double- and triple-teams and constant fouling tactics that opposing teams used to try to shut him down.</p>

                        <h3>Clyde Drexler</h3>
                        <p>One of the game’s all-time great guards, Clyde “The Glide” Drexler was known for his high-flying yet seemingly effortless swoops to the basket.After almost a dozen seasons with the Portland Trail Blazers, Drexler left Portland with his name all over the franchise’s record books. A perennial All-Star and a member of the 1992 U.S. Olympic Dream Team, Drexler twice led the Blazers to The Finals. It wasn’t until he joined the Houston Rockets midway through his 12th campaign, however, that he finally earned a championship ring.</p>

                        <h3>Patrick Ewing</h3>
                        <p>Warrior.That is the one-word description often applied to Patrick Ewing.He was indefatigable and relentless in pursuit of an NBA championship despite being denied on an annual basis. Bold predictions did not always materialize and some took them as empty promises, while others as a will to succeed. One of the finest shooting centers to play, he left the game as the New York Knicks’ all-time leader in nearly every significant category and the game’s 13th all-time scorer with 24,815 points.</p>

                        <h3>Magic Johnson</h3>
                        <p>Few athletes are truly unique, changing the way their sport is played with their singular skills. Earvin “Magic” Johnson was one of them.Just how great a basketball player was Johnson? So great, perhaps, that future generations of hoop fans may wish they had entered the world years earlier — just so they could have seen Magic play in person instead of watching him only on highlight reels.</p>

                        <h3>Michael Jordan</h3>
                        <p>By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time. Although, a summary of his basketball career and influence on the game inevitably fails to do it justice, as a phenomenal athlete with a unique combination of fundamental soundness, grace, speed, power, artistry, improvisational ability and an unquenchable competitive desire, Jordan single-handedly redefined the NBA superstar.</p>

                        <h3>Reggie Miller</h3>
                        <p>A volatile, high-voltage scorer from the off guard position, Reggie Miller was one of the supreme shooters of any era. With 2,560 made 3-pointers, he ended his career as the NBA’s greatest long-range shooter. He poured in 25,279 points to finish his career in 12th place on the league’s all-time scoring list.</p>

                        <h3>Scottie Pippen</h3>
                        <p>One of the most versatile and talented players ever, Scottie Pippen orchestrated the offense like a point guard, rebounded like a power forward, scored like a shooting guard and defended on the perimeter like few others. The seven-time All-Star was a vital component of the Chicago Bulls’ six NBA championships in the 1990s.</p>
